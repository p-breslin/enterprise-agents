  - Created date
  - Updated date
  - Due date
  - End date (resolution date if available)
  - Description

  Group this information in a readable format per issue.

  This is for formatting into structured JSON later. Do not return JSON yourself. Just return a clean, readable list of issues.

structure_prompt: |
  You are formatting issue data from Jira.

  Return a JSON array of objects with this structure:
  {
    "issue_type": string,
    "issue_id": string,
    ...
    "description": string
  }

  Only return the array. No commentary and do not add explanations or extra text.
